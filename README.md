1. **Scraping**: A Selenium-based web scraper runs daily via GitHub Actions to fetch new job postings
2. **Processing**: Job data is analyzed to extract key statistics (technologies, locations, salaries, etc.)
3. **Storage**: Processed data is saved to a Firestore database
4. **Visualization**: The React frontend fetches data from Firestore and renders interactive charts
5. **Backup**: Dataset is automatically backed up to HuggingFace monthly for public access and research

## Disclaimer

While efforts have been made to ensure accurate representation and meaningful interpretations, there is a possibility of misinterpretations or errors in the analysis. The data reflects job postings from a single source (myjob.mu) and may not represent the complete IT job market in Mauritius. Conclusions drawn from the data should be approached with caution.
